Hi there.

This is a repo that I created on 21st October 2023.
Motive: To learn SSH (Secure Shell) key and HTTPS route of connecting local and remote repos.

Finally, I learned what it actually is to push files from a linux environment to Github or any remote server via SSH.
I learned the importance of SSH.

1) SSH isn't about more security but it's a way for authentication. Remote server authenticates the user credentials before accepting any push request via SSH.
2) At the core it is a key. On the surface it is a storage that has one's login/sign-in credentials.

This is the gist of what SSH actually is.
I'll be posting a complete step-by-step procedure for someone who's delving into git and github from a linux machine very soon.
